This design is completed for the mockup provided.

**How to run the project**

1. Install Node JS and npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. git clone this repositry to your local storage
3. Install all node modules from the package.json by command 'npm install'
4. Run command 'npm run start' to run on local server (localhost:8080).
5. Run command 'npm run build' to get static contents. 
(This will produce static contents in the project directory (inside dist/). These contain the compiled CSS and transpiled JS, which you can then copy into a directory served by any web server.)
